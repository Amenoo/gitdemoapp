  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <t1>We are four guys who have no idea what were supposed to do.</t1>
  <br>
  <t1>We are also very confused in general with questions like "what is code? What is programming? and what the hell does all this goobledygook mean?"</t1>
  <br>
  <t1>So bassically we're a bunch of stupid, dumb teenage boys who know next to nothing. Toodles and help</t1>
